Nvidia: Leading AI Innovation

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company
Nvidia Corporation is a multinational technology company known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), semiconductor products, and in more recent years its role in the development and advancement of generative AI. 

* When was the company incorporated?
The company was incorporated April 5, 1993 and is headquartered in Santa Clara, California.  (Nvidia, About Us)

* Who are the founders of the company?
Founders Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem did not initially have a name for the company and eventually landed on NV [idia] as in ‘Next Version’ based on the naming convention for their file labeling system.

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
According to the information shared on the Nvidia website, “More than 4 million developers now create thousands of applications for accelerated computing. More than 40,000 companies use NVIDIA AI technologies, with 15,000 global startups in NVIDIA Inception.” (Nvidia, A Timeline of Innovation). Looking back 30 years, the company’s initial vision was to bring 3D graphics to the gaming and multimedia markets. By 1999 they invented the GPU, an inflection point setting the stage for Nvidia’s products reshaping the industry. The founders believed that for computers graphics to evolve, a dedicated GPU would be needed. Before that concept, computer games were entirely CPU-based (TechTarget). Since establishing itself as a premier graphics chip provider, the company has moved into high performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI). In 2012 they powered the groundbreaking AlexNet neural network essentially starting of the era of modern AI as we know it today. In 2018 they introduced the NVIDIA RTX reinventing computer graphics in gaming. In 2022 the company was a key player in the building of the metaverse with the Nvidia Omniverse platform. 

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
The founders were funded with an initial $40,000 investment, then later funded more extensively from venture capitalist, including Sequoia Capital. 


## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Generative AI as the new computing platform allows companies to create their own AI factories, Nvidia essentially engineers the advanced chips, systems, and software for these companies lending generative AI and digitalization to transform industrial design, engineering, manufacturing, autonomous driving, and customer experience processes.  
The company’s primary products include GPU for areas such as gaming, professional visualization, data centers, and automotive markets. These GPUs can be found in gaming consoles, personal computers, and a variety of AI applications. In the gaming arena, NVIDIA RTX, and later this year, DLSS 3, taps into AI and ray tracing to deliver a whole new level of realism in graphics. Another one of its more ameliorative goals is to also solve the issue of global electricity consumption; today ~2% of global electivity is used by data centers, a state of affairs that is not sustainable. Nvidia’s position as stated on their website is that, “Acceleration is the best way to reclaim power and achieve sustainability and net zero” (“Nvidia – About us)

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
Nvidia’s chips have moved beyond its video game space, to enterprise AI models, the metaverse, and self-driving cars. Today the company is looking to take advantage of the cloud based generative AI opportunity. The company’s value has soared as demand for its data center products from companies like AWS, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Oracle has exploded. What sets Nvidia apart, and what had driven over $10 billion in record sales in July of this year is the growing importance of specialty chips in business, as well as the accelerated interest in generative AI.  

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
Nvidia produces what is known as ‘discrete’ GPUs that does parallel computing. Unlike CPUs that carries out programming sequentially, GPUs can carry out multiple processes simultaneously and therefore much more efficiently. This makes Nvidia chips better suited for AI software programing and subsequently has driven demand for its products. While other chip designers like Intel are working to catch up, Nvidia, with over thirty years of specialized focus, holds a huge competitive advantage. They are able to charge a premium for their services in a market that suffers from a shortage of chips precipitated by the outsized demand to build AI capabilities. (Wile)
The need in recent years for companies to have the capability to perform trillions of repetitive calculations for machine learning models has exploded demand. This coupled with the additional demand in the cryptocurrency mining space where Nvidia’s GPU serves as a more energy efficient way to perform calculations, is behind the significant rise in market valuation for the company. Additionally, interest in AI tools like ChatGPT, which was developed on Nvidia’s hardware, has created even more need for their hardware and software to help with the training and development for the large language models (LLM) on which generative AI is based (Sayer)
Still, what has allowed Nvidia to create what NY Times reporter, Don Clark ‘a moat around AI Chips’ – is not only that it is known to upgrade its products with new features to counters whatever product start up competitors might build, but more importantly, it has set itself apart by creating a large community of programmers who invent using the company’s products and technology. (Clark)

## Landscape

* What field is the company in?
Essentially Nvidia seized on the AI trend early and tailored its products to tasks that support AI development. In the past decade, the company has developed a clear lead in chip development with features like speech recognition, facial recognition, and generative text for chatbots. Additionally, in a move to retain its competitive advantage, the company has allowed its customers access to specialized computing services and other emerging tools as they are developed – making them a one stop shop for all things AI development. 
## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
Mr. Huang, Nvidia’s CEP has spoken extensively on the evolution of computing, In his words the field is going through ‘the biggest shift since IBM defined how most systems and software operate 60 years ago’. It’s a landscape where GPUs and specialized chips will replace microprocessors and chatbot will replace complex coding software. The intention, as Mr. Huang lays it out, is for Nvidia to produce and build everything to support that end-to-end process. (Clark)

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?
While its competitors like Google, Amazon, Meta, and IBM compete for the 30% of market share for AI chips, Nvidia controls the remaining 70%. Nvidia controls 90% of the high margin arena of GPUs built to run accelerated computing applications. Competitors like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel are working to expand their capabilities but analysts expect that Nvidia will remain dominant. When it comes to the gaming space, according to Steam, the biggest storefront for PC gaming, their most recent hardware survey results show that more that 76% of its users own a Nvidia GPU with competitor AMD a distant second at 15%, then Intel with 8.6%. (Siladitya)
* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?
In 2023 Nvidia surpassed $1 trillion in market capitalization to become the world’s most valuable chip maker. (Clark) Nvidia’s stock has risen by 240% over the past twelve months and is up 82% so far in 2024. The company is now valued at over $2 trillion, behind only Microsoft and Apple among U.S. firms. Apple and Microsoft still generate more revenue but Nvidia, with its high margin indicative of the growing demand for its GPUs for AI services, is poised to surpass both in growth over the next few years.  Currently both its sales, earnings, and propensity to continue to innovate in a way that meets specific AI developmental needs positions Nvidia to potentially claim the title of world’s most valuable business.(Noonan)
Nvidia Corporation has so far proven it is the market leader of technological innovation, pushing advancements in graphics processing, high performance computing, and AI. With a history of pioneering developments and the drive to meet market demands, Nvidia is now poised to be the leader in the tech industry.
